# cdnJS Script Repository

[cdnJS](http://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) is the repository mirroring all scripts on `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, created and maintained by [Thomas Davis](https://twitter.com/neutralthoughts), [Ryan Kirkman](https://twitter.com/ryan_kirkman) and [Pete Cooper](http://twitter.com/petecooper)

We will host any version of any library, subject to popularity and licence permissions.

__Libraries must have notable popularity: 100 stars or watchers on GitHub is a good example, but as long as reasonable popularity can be demonstrated the library will be added.__

Evidence of popularity should be included in your pull request if the GitHub project doesn't indicate this already.

Please raise a pull request for an older version of a library if your site still uses it, and also for proposals for new libraries.

## Adding a new or updating an existing library

cdnJS relies on user-submitted pull requests and automatic updating via `npm` to populate and update libraries. To add a new library, or update an existing library outside of `npm`, start by [forking the cdnJS repo](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/fork) to your own GitHub account.

If you're adding/modifying outside of the GitHub browser interface, for example on the command line or with the GitHub desktop application, you will need to additionally install `node` locally. For more information on installing `node`, please refer to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

When you have forked the cdnJS repo, add your library to it. Libraries are stored in the `ajax/libs` directory. Each library has its own subdirectory of `ajax/libs` and each version of the library has its own subdirectory of the library directory name, for example:

```
/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/
```

## Conventions

You should consider the following when adding to or updating the library:

* Filenames should **not** include a version number and be **lowercase**. This is OK: `useful.min.js`, but this is not: `useful-2.0.1.min.js`.

* JavaScript & CSS files should be minified to reduce network and browser overhead. If the library doesn't already provide a minified version, cdnJS's preferred JavaScript minifier is [UglifyJS](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs "UglifyJS")

* If you are updating a library, please try to maintain consistency with the existing file and directory structure. There will be occasions, particularly with major version increments, where this is not practical. If there are significant changes in the file structure, please note this in your pull request.


## Create or update `package.json`

Each library has a corresponding `package.json`, written in `npm` format (see `test/schemata/npm-package.json` for details or use another `package.json` to crib from - it's very simple). When an existing library is updated, the details in `package.json` should be updated where required. For example, if a new version of the library is added, the version number may need changing.

## Run `npm test` to check all is well

If you're updating the library outside of `npm` or the GitHub browser, you should run `npm test` from the library directory to ensure everything is OK.

If you run `npm test` and see no errors, all is well; resolve any errors before you raise your pull request and re-run `npm test` to ensure everything works.

You may see a warning about a missing readme file - you can ignore this. Libraries on cdnJS do not require a readme file.

## Pull request pre-flight checks

* Have you followed the library directory structure?
* Does a valid and accurate `package.json` exist for the library?
* Have you minified JavaScript and CSS?
* Did `npm test` check out OK?

...if so, you're ready to raise a pull request.

## Raising a pull request

Please restrict your pull request to one library. From a maintenance standpoint, it's much more straightforward to process pull requests where there is one commit for one library.

In your pull request title, tell us what you're doing. If you are the author of the library, please add `[author]` to the pull request title.

Please include the following in your pull request:

* The origin of your library files (e.g., where you downloaded it)
* How you found the version of the script (e.g., `Source: http://github.com/example/releases/1.2.3.zip`)
* Evidence of popularity if the GitHub numbers don't indicate popularity.

Providing the origin of your files is very helpful as the cdnJS project is peer-reviewed.

## Enabling `npm` auto update

__We are currently in the process of converting as many libraries to NPM auto update as possible. For a bit of fun, cdnjs will send you **$5 USD in Bitcoin for each library you convert to NPM auto-update**. If you could tag your pull request with [BC] and throw your Bitcoin address in the commit, we will send your payment through as soon as possible. If you would like to keep your BC address private, send an email to thomasalwyndavis@gmail.com with the details.__

cdnJS automatically updates libraries that are known to be hosted on `npm` e.g., Lodash. This auto-update script runs every 15 minutes.

To add an `npm` hook to a library, update the `package.json` with configuration details and submit your pull request. An example configuration:

```
 // Lodash package.json
 // ...
  "npmName": "lodash",
  "npmFileMap": [{
    "basePath": "/dist/",
    "files": [
      "*.js"
    ]
  }],
  // ...
```

* `npmName` should map to the name of the library on `npm`
* `npmFileMap` is a list of files to take from the `npm` tarball and host on cdnJS
* `basePath` will be ignored when copying over to the CDN
* `files` is a pattern matcher allowing selection of multiple files

The above example looks in the tarball whose structure might look like this:

```
- dist/lodash.js
- dist/lodash.min.js
```

The auto-update process will look for `dist` inside the named tarball and copy all the JavaScript file(s) to cdnJS, minus the `dist` path. The resulting files in cdnJS will be: 

```
ajax/libs/lodash.js/1.0.0/lodash.js
ajax/libs/lodash.js/1.0.0/lodash.min.js
```

## API

You can search cdnJS via our API:

```
http://api.cdnjs.com/libraries
```

Without any query parameters it will return the name and main file URL of every library on cdnJS. To search, use:

```
http://api.cdnjs.com/libraries?search=jquery
```

If you would like more data, use the fields parameter which takes comma-separated values:

```
http://api.cdnjs.com/libraries?search=jquery&fields=version,description
```

To get a list of all files for that library, use the assets field:

```
http://api.cdnjs.com/libraries?search=jquery&fields=assets
```

Other fields available are:

```
version
description
homepage
keywords
maintainers
assets
```

The API is served over Cloudflare with a 6 hour expiry for requests
