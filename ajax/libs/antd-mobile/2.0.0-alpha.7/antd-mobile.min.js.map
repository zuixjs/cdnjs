A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n\t * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n\t * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n\t * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n\t *\n\t * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n\t * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n\t * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n\t * whether to re-render it or not.\n\t *\n\t * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n\t * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n\t * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n\t * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n\t * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n\t * it.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * getInitialState: function() {\n\t *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n\t *   return {ds};\n\t * },\n\t * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n\t *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n\t *   this.setState({\n\t *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n\t *   });\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n\t   * headers and rows.

The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others).

The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.

Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others).
