The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n\t * keyboard could be dismissed.\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\t\n\t// type State = {\n\t//     isTouching: boolean;\n\t//     lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number;\n\t//     lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number;\n\t//     observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean;\n\t//     becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean;\n\t// };\n\t// type Event = Object;\n\t\n\tvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n\t  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n\t  // statics: RCTScrollViewConsts,\n\t  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n\t    return {\n\t      isTouching: false,\n\t      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n\t      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\t\n\t      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

See the test for more.\n  // See also:\n  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n  }\n\n  return reactClass;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\n  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n    // we mutate the mixin so let's clone it\n    mixin = assign({}, mixin);\n    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n  };\n\n  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n    return function(reactClass) {\n      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n    };\n  };\n\n  return reactMixin;\n})();\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/react-mixin/index.js\n ** module id = 404\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _reactDom = require('react-dom');\n\nvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\nvar _channel = require('./channel');\n\nvar _channel2 = _interopRequireDefault(_channel);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\nfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\nfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.
