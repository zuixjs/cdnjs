A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n\t * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n\t * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n\t * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n\t *\n\t * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n\t * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n\t * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n\t * whether to re-render it or not.\n\t *\n\t * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n\t * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n\t * data source.

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.
