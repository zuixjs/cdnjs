The input blob can be as simple as an\n\t * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n\t *\n\t * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n\t * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n\t * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n\t * whether to re-render it or not.\n\t *\n\t * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n\t * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n\t * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n\t * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n\t * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n\t * it.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * getInitialState: function() {\n\t *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n\t *   return {ds};\n\t * },\n\t * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n\t *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n\t *   this.setState({\n\t *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n\t *   });\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n\t   * headers and rows.

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.
