The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

The input blob can be as simple as an\n\t * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n\t *\n\t * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n\t * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n\t * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n\t * whether to re-render it or not.\n\t *\n\t * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n\t * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n\t * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n\t * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n\t * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n\t * it.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * getInitialState: function() {\n\t *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n\t *   return {ds};\n\t * },\n\t * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n\t *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n\t *   this.setState({\n\t *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n\t *   });\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n\t   * headers and rows.

The minimal API is to create a\n * `ListView.DataSource`, populate it with a simple array of data blobs, and\n * instantiate a `ListView` component with that data source and a `renderRow`\n * callback which takes a blob from the data array and returns a renderable\n * component.\n *\n * Minimal example:\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   let ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n *   return {\n *     dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n *   };\n * },\n *\n * render: function() {\n *   return (\n *     <ListView\n *       dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n *       renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n *     />\n *   );\n * },\n * ```\n *\n * ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\n * section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\n * the available data (`onEndReached`) and on the set of rows that are visible\n * in the device viewport change (`onChangeVisibleRows`), and several\n * performance optimizations.\n *\n * There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\n * smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\n * infinite) data sets:\n *\n *  * Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\n *    data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\n *    source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.\n *\n *  * Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\n *    event-loop (customizable with the `pageSize` prop).  This breaks up the\n *    work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\n *    rendering rows.\n */\n\nvar ListView = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(ListView, _React$Component);\n\n  function ListView() {\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, ListView);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args))), _this), _this.state = {\n      curRenderedRowsCount: _this.props.initialListSize,\n      highlightedRow: {}\n    }, _this.stickyRefs = {}, _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * You must provide a renderRow function.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\n// type State = {\n//     isTouching: boolean;\n//     lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number;\n//     lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number;\n//     observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean;\n//     becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean;\n// };\n// type Event = Object;\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  // statics: RCTScrollViewConsts,\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.
